                <h2><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
                <div>Greetings! I'm Shahil Mahato, an aspiring computer science enthusiast currently navigating the
                    fascinating world of technology. My academic journey has led me to pursue a BCA at George College,
                    an institution affiliated with Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad University.
                    <div>
                        <h2><u>TECHNICAL EXPERTISE</u></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div>My technical journey has been shaped by a robust foundation in Core Java, JDBC, Servlet, JSP,
                        and JSTL. I honed these skills during my industrial training at Euphoria Genx, where I delved
                        into both core and advanced aspects of Java development.
                        <br>Beyond Java, I possess a keen understanding of web development technologies, including HTML
                        and CSS/SCSS. This blend of skills allows me to craft dynamic and visually appealing web
                        applications.
                        <br>Database management is another facet of my expertise. I have hands-on experience working
                        with both MySQL and Oracle, ensuring seamless integration of databases into my projects.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2><u>EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND</u></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div>My educational journey began with the successful completion of my 10+2 from WBCHSE, with a
                        specialization in the science stream. This formative experience laid the groundwork for my
                        subsequent academic pursuits.
                        <br>Prior to that, I navigated the challenges of the ICSE board, completing my 10th-grade
                        education. This diverse educational background reflects my adaptability and commitment to a
                        holistic learning experience.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2><u>INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE</u></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div>One of the pivotal chapters in my journey involved immersive industrial training at Euphoria
                        Genx. This experience not only expanded my technical skill set but also provided real-world
                        insights into the dynamic field of Java development.</div>
                    <div>The training encompassed both Core and Advanced Java, affording me a comprehensive
                        understanding of the intricacies involved in building robust and efficient applications.</div>
                </div>
